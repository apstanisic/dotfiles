# Gembird Controller
---

I'm using 2 generic Gembird controllers that have incorrect mappings, 
so this folder contains config for Lutris to correct them.

## Files
---

### gamecontrollerdb.txt

This is file that contains correct mappings

### gembird.gamecontroller.amgp

This file contains other gamepad config, like better deadzones.
